synopsis: "Find perceptible pixel differences with OCaml"
description: """\
Pixeldrift is an OCaml module to find perceptible pixel differences
between two equally sized sRGB images with an alpha component. It is
mostly suitable for comparing synthetic images: diagrams, user
interface screenshots, rendering algorithms outputs, etc.

Pixeldrift has no dependencies. It is distributed under the ISC
license. The command line tool depends on [cmdliner].
