pixeldrift â€” Find perceptible pixel differences with OCaml
==========================================================
%%VERSION%%

Pixeldrift is an OCaml module to find perceptible pixel differences
between two equally sized sRGB images with an alpha component. It is
mostly suitable for comparing synthetic images: diagrams, user
interface screenshots, rendering algorithms outputs, etc.

Pixeldrift has no dependencies. It is distributed under the ISC
license. The command line tool depends on [cmdliner].

# Installation

Pixeldrift can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install pixeldrift
    opam install cmdliner pixeldrift  # For the command line tool

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

# Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online][doc] or via `odig doc pixeldrift`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum][ocaml-forum] 
than on the issue tracker.

For the command line tool consult `pixeldrift --help`.
